## About
A website that enables users to keep track of NBA players that they may find interesting. The site will be powered by Express JS, and later include React to serve dynamic webpages that has its content filled from database queries.

## Motivation
This project will serve as a marriage of my passions involving professional sports, data/analytics, engineering concepts and the management of a robust codebase with many moving parts and important, self-made algorithms. 

## Contributors
